## Installed languages and packages

This Codespace includes Python and R with popular data science packages installed:

- Python: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `requests`

- R: `tidyverse`

If you think we should add other languages or packages [create an issue](https://github.com/stencila/demo-codespace/issues/new), or submit a PR with changes to the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/stencila/demo-codespace/edit/main/.devcontainer/Dockerfile).

## Customizing the Codespace

You can [create a fork](https://github.com/stencila/demo-codespace/fork) of this repository and modify the following files to customize the environment:

- add language runtimes and packages to `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`

- add VSCode extensions to `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`

We are [planning](https://github.com/stencila/demo-codespace/issues/3) to make it easier to fork and customize this repository in the future.
